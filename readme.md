# Currency To Text (c2t)

## Description

The script converts an amount into a string text like the text used in a check but, in this case is made for Mexico; in fact, I made this because this tiny project is going to be a part in a bigger project.

<br>

It has 2 python scripts:
<br>
1. The "launcher", this script works as a launcher and from here it asks for the amount and create the final text string.
2. The functions script, it contains the "engine" where the program works with the amount to get the text of each part of the amount.

<br>

To be honest I don't feel good with the way I did these scripts, I think I can reduce the lines of code of both scripts and improve the functionality and this is my next step therefore I'm going to update them soon.
